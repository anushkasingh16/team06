## Overview

## User Interface

Our UI is focused on some basic principles of user experience and design, primarily the following:

* Consistency: Making sure that our elements, colours, fonts, logo, and all the buttons were consistent in terms of design. Aditionally, we also wanted to be consistent in terms of functionaility and made sure to have each feature play out in a similar manner for the user.

* User Feedback: We focused on making sure that for every action a user perfomed they would get feedback from our webapp, in terms of either the express routes changing or in terms of notifications, alters, changing colours, etc. 

* Accesibility - We tried our best to add alternative text for screen readers, and made sure we worked with sans serif fonts, etc. The goal was to work with colors that wouldn't cause the user strain or flashing lights.

Some screenshots of our project are as follows:

### The flow of our website starts with with the **main page** as shown below:
