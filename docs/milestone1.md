# Milestone 1

## Team Name: Team 06 - Text Swap

### Application Name: Text Swap

### Innovative Idea

Our web app lets us connect people on campus who are looking for certain textbooks with people hoping to buy/swap for them! We let users make listings and tell us which books they need, and then we match them with other students on campus who are looking to sell or swap those books. Once the users are matched, our application helps them set up a meeting time and place to swap via messaging. The app can also let you split the cost of textbooks if you and a friend want to share a textbook for a class, or even perform swaps with multiple people so everyone can get the textbooks they need.

### Important Components:

Users will have to sign up on the website to start making a profile. Only emails ending with umass.edu will be allowed to sign up so only students have access to the app. Other information included with a user's profile are the textbooks they are listing, their username, the total number of textbook swaps they have done as well as options to include their phone number and address to help conduct trades with people.

Textbooks that are listed will also have a profile that includes their ISBN, condition, title, edition and a picture of the book to ensure good condition. Our webpage will also have an algorithm to match people that are looking for a textbook with people that have the textbook they need as well as set up multiple swaps if necessary. The app will also include the ability to message other users once a match has been made so they can set up a time and place to swap, or share their address to ship textbooks to.

Additionally, if users are not swapping but only want to buy a book, we also have the option of letting them “split and share” with other users who are looking for the same book. If the user doesn’t have someone to split with, our application will connect them with other users who also want to split.

### The flow of our website starts with with the **main page** as shown below:

### Once you are at the **main page**, the user can **sign in/log in** as shown below:

### After the user logs in/ signs up we take them to the **home page** as shown below:

### At the **home page**, there are a few componets that build up our user interface. The features are listed as follows:

#### User Profile
